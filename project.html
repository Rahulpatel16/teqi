                        Form 15CA is a declaration form available to peoples who require to file for foreign remittances made outside India.
                        As per my client's requirements, i have prepared this software which helps them to convert all Excel data to XML file (i.e Form 15CA Format) as this website only accepts the form submitted in XML Format
                        which has to be uploaded on Income Tax's Website, I have created this software with the help of python.
